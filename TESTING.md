### Full Testing

Full testing can be tedious, so it is great to try and break this part up into smaller chunks and do a bit at a time. Full testing is when you go through the site and test every single thing that can be tested. So for example you would test that all links in the navbar correctly redirect the user to where there are supposed to go. A table is the perfect way to display this information.

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

List (or put in a table) all known bugs on your site here as soon as you find them. This will prevent you from forgetting any at the end. Some (if not all) of these bugs will hopefully make their way over to the next section, solved bugs, as you progress through your project.

### Solved Bugs

üë©üèª‚ÄçüíªView an example of a completed bugs section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm/blob/main/TESTING.md#BUGS)

This is where all solved bugs go once squashed. List what the bug was, and how you managed to fix it. You can also include images/videos here if you wanted.
