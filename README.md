## Design

### Colour Scheme

The client go to pick colour scheme from this page: https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/
She had three she liked better. I picked the one I thought it worked best with her logo.

### Typography

I used the Raleway font from Google Fonts. I thought it worked well with the style of the logo and the services.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

The imagery is mainly of Sussie and her fascilities, showing a friendly and peaceful enviroment.

### Wirerfames

Wireframes of the index page was made:

## Features

The web page has a "Home" page with a greeting from the bussiness owner explaining what it is she does. 

There is also a page where costumers can leave and read reviews. In case of many reviews a pagination function is added.

 Services and prices can be found on another page.

 There is also a page with contact information as well as pages for signing up and signing in and out of an account.


### General features on each page

The web page has a navigation menu, making it easy to navigate between pages.

### Future Implementations

In the future I would like to add a booking system directly on the web page instead of linking to an outside service. The page would also benefit from a page were news of project of services can be posted.
